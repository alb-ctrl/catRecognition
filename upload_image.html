   <form enctype = "multipart/form-data" action = "save_file.py" id="new_cat">

  <p>This model is built from images of different breeds of cats.
    100 images of each label were compiled. This image set was partitioned into batches for a training model and a training set.
     After the training of the model was complete, the testing set (of size n=100) had a validation accuracy rate of 95%. A Cross entropy of 0.340869
     This accuracy rate could be improved by using a bigger sample size of images for the training set. 
     To improve accuracy, I could have also increased the number of training steps used in training the model (In order to save time, 
     I only let the training command iterate for a maximum of 500 times.)</p>
<p>
  Another way to increase the accuracy of my model would've been to use
   <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/data_augmentation">Data Augmentation</a><br> 
   Data augmentation is when you make a small, existing dataset larger through manipulating each image to create slightly different copies of it. 
   This is helpful for smaller datasets.
